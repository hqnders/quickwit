# quickwit
Quick Wit is a Discord Event organiser bot, specifically for FF14 events. Created by `hqnders` on Discord for the Ex Animo Free Company.

docker container create -e DISCORD_TOKEN=[token] -e ADMIN_USER_ID=[your-user-id] -v quickwit:/app/data --name quickwit quickwit:latest

```

## Environment Variables
The following environment variables are taken into account to configure running Quick Wit:
| **Variable** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | The token of the bot used to serve Quick Wit |
| `ADMIN_USER_ID` | Optional user ID of who the bot will message when encountering an error |
| `DISABLED_COGS` | Optional comma-seperated list of Cog names that will be disabled on starting up |
| `EVENT_CHANNEL_CATEGORY` | Optional name of the event category to create event channels in |
| `EVENT_ROLE` | Optional name of the role to ping for events |

# Bot Requirements
## Event Channel Category
All events shall be created under a specialized category, by default this category is named `events`.
Ensure the permissions within this category are setup correctly.
Individual event channel permissions will be edited to allow the event host to manage the channel and send messages,
while default users shall be allowed to send messages in the created thread.

## Emojis
The bot will automatically use '‚ùì' in place of emojis it cannot match by name.
Specificially, it tries to search for every emoji without spaces and ignoring case sensitivity.
Please register the following emojis for full event representation:
```

## Intents
The only intent necessary is `members`, as the bot reads people's name when mentioning who joined via scheduled event interest.

# Development
## Architecture
The project attempts to follow a Model View Controller architecture whenever possible, 
with the controllers being implemented as `discord.py` cogs.
