# quickwit
Quick Wit is a Discord Event organiser bot, specifically for FF14 events. Created by `hqnders` on Discord for the Ex Animo Free Company.

To deploy (docker):
```
docker build -t quickwit:latest -f Dockerfile --network=host .
docker volume create quickwit
docker container create -e DISCORD_TOKEN=[token] -e ADMIN_USER_ID=[your-user-id] -v quickwit:/app/data --name quickwit quickwit:latest
docker container start quickwit
```

# Bot Requirements
## Emojis
The bot will automatically use '‚ùì' in place of emojis it cannot match by name.
Currently there is an emoji associated to every value of every enumerator found in the `models/` folder.
Specificially, it tries to search for an emoji that is equal to the enumerator value, without spaces, ignoring case sensitivity.
Please also register the following emojis for full event representation:
```
Start
Duration
Organiser
People
```

## Intents
The only intent necessary is `members`, as the bot reads people's name when mentioning who joined via scheduled event interest.

# Development
## Architecture
The project attempts to follow a Model View Controller architecture whenever possible, 
with the controllers being implemented as `discord.py` cogs.

## Event Map
The following table provides an overview of which Cog interacts with which event
